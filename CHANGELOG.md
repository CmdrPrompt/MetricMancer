### Planned / In Development

**Git/Bitbucket-based KPIs:**

- Code Ownership: Measures how many different developers have modified a file. Identifies files with low ownership (high risk for bugs). Can be retrieved via `git log --pretty="%an" <file>`.
- Review Latency: Time from pull request creation to first comment. Highlights bottlenecks in the review process. Retrieved via Bitbucket API: `/pullrequests/{id}/comments`.
- Merge Time: Time from PR creation to merge. Measures collaboration and delivery speed. Bitbucket API: `/pullrequests/{id}` with timestamps.
- Comment Density: Number of comments per PR. Indicator of code review quality. Can be combined with Review Latency for a "Review Health Score".

**Jira-based KPIs:**

- Cycle Time: Time from "In Progress" to "Done". Measures delivery speed. Retrieved via Jira API: `issue.changelog` â†’ status changes.
- Lead Time: Time from issue creation to delivery. Identifies bottlenecks in planning and prioritization.
- Issue Reopen Rate: How often issues are reopened after being closed. Indicator of solution quality and test coverage.
- Sprint Accuracy: Amount of planned work actually delivered. Measures team predictability.
- Flow Efficiency: Active time vs. waiting time in the issue flow. Identifies waste in the process.

**Combined Metric Ideas:**

- Risk Index = churn Ã— complexity Ã— ownership diversity
- Review Health Score = comment density Ã· review latency
- Delivery Score = sprint accuracy Ã— flow efficiency
- Stability Score = low churn Ã— high complexity Ã— low reopen rate

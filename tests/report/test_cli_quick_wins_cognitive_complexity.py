RED Phase: Tests for Cognitive Complexity in Quick Wins Report

Following TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR:
- ðŸ”´ RED: These tests SHOULD FAIL initially
- ðŸŸ¢ GREEN: Implement minimal code to make them pass
- ðŸ”µ REFACTOR: Clean up implementation

Tests verify:
1. Cognitive complexity contributes to impact score
2. Cognitive complexity appears in action recommendations
3. High cognitive complexity triggers specific actions
4. Quick wins data includes cognitive complexity values

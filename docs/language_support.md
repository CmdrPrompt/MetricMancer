|-----------|-----------|-----------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **JSON** | `.json` | ✅ Structural | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Complete |
| **YAML** | `.yaml`, `.yml` | ✅ Structural | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Complete |
| **Shell Scripts** | `.sh`, `.bash` | ✅ Cyclomatic | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Complete |

**Complexity Metrics:**
- **JSON/YAML**: Nesting depth, object count, array complexity, key count
- **Shell**: Control flow (if/case), loops, functions, logical operators (&&/||)

### Documentation & Other Files (Partial Support)

These files don't have complexity parsers but **still get review recommendations** based on churn and ownership:

| File Type | Extensions | Complexity | Code Churn | Ownership | Review Strategy |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Documentation** | `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst` | ❌ (Set to 0) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Churn-based |
| **Config (Other)** | `.toml`, `.ini`, `.conf` | ❌ (Set to 0) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Impact-based |
| **Build Files** | `.xml`, `.gradle`, `Makefile` | ❌ (Set to 0) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Churn-based |

## 🎯 How Review Strategy Works Per File Type

### For Programming Languages (with Complexity Parser)

**Full Analysis Available:**
```
File: app/analyzer.py (Python)
   Complexity: 90       ← Measured by PythonComplexityParser (Cyclomatic)
   Churn: 20.0          ← Git log analysis
   Hotspot: 1800        ← Complexity × Churn
   Ownership: Shared    ← Git blame analysis
   
   Risk Level: CRITICAL
   Review Strategy: Focus on complexity management, refactoring opportunities
```

**Risk Classification:**
- Uses complexity + churn for accurate risk assessment
- Hotspot score identifies critical areas
- Detailed review checklists based on complexity patterns

### For Configuration Files (JSON/YAML)

**Structural Complexity Analysis:**
```
File: .github/workflows/python-app.yml (YAML)
   Complexity: 32       ← Structural: nesting + objects + anchors
   Churn: 8.0           ← Git log analysis
   Hotspot: 256         ← Complexity × Churn
   Ownership: Balanced  ← Git blame analysis
   
   Risk Level: HIGH
   Review Strategy: Focus on workflow logic, dependency updates, breaking changes
```

**Complexity Factors:**
- **JSON**: Nesting depth (×2), objects, arrays, keys (÷10)
- **YAML**: + Anchors/aliases, multi-line strings, documents

```
File: package.json (JSON)
   Complexity: 15       ← Structural: dependencies + nesting
   Churn: 12.0          ← Frequently updated
   Hotspot: 180         
   Ownership: Shared
   
   Risk Level: HIGH
   Review Strategy: Dependency security, version conflicts, breaking changes
```

### For IDL (Interface Definition Language)

**Structural Complexity Analysis:**
```
File: BankingService.idl (IDL)
   Complexity: 19       ← Structural: interfaces (3) + operations (8) + structs (2) + exceptions (2)
   Churn: 5.0           ← Git log analysis
   Hotspot: 95          ← Complexity × Churn
   Ownership: Single    ← Git blame analysis
   
   Risk Level: MEDIUM
   Review Strategy: Interface compatibility, breaking changes, operation signatures
```

**Complexity Factors:**
- Interfaces: +3 each (define contracts)
- Structs/Exceptions: +2 each (data structures)
- Operations (methods): +2 each (behavior)
- Unions: +3 each (conditional data)
- Inheritance: +2 each (dependencies)
- Nesting depth: +2 per level beyond 1
- Sequences/Arrays: +1 each (collection types)

### For Shell Scripts

**Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis:**
```
File: deploy.sh (Shell)
   Complexity: 18       ← Control flow: if (3), loops (2), functions (2), && (4)
   Churn: 15.0          ← Git log analysis
   Hotspot: 270         ← Complexity × Churn
   Ownership: Single    ← Git blame analysis
   
   Risk Level: CRITICAL
   Review Strategy: Error handling, idempotency, logging, rollback procedures
```

**Complexity Factors:**
- Control statements: `if`, `elif`, `case`
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `until`
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`
- Functions: Bash function definitions

### For Non-Code Files (without Complexity Parser)

**Churn & Ownership Analysis:**
```
File: README.md
   Complexity: 0        ← No parser available
   Churn: 15.0          ← Git log analysis
   Hotspot: 0           ← 0 × 15 = 0
   Ownership: Single    ← Git blame analysis
   
   Risk Level: MEDIUM (based on high churn)
   Review Strategy: Focus on documentation quality, consistency
```

**Risk Classification:**
- Uses churn as primary indicator
- Ownership patterns detect documentation debt
- Review focus on content quality and maintenance

### Special Cases

**1. Configuration Files (JSON/YAML)**
```
File: package.json
   Complexity: 0
   Churn: 8.0
   
   Risk Level: MEDIUM
   Review Focus: Dependency changes, security implications, version conflicts
```

**2. Frequently Updated Documentation**
```
File: CHANGELOG.md
   Complexity: 0
   Churn: 12.0
   
   Risk Level: LOW (expected high churn)
   Review Focus: Completeness, accuracy
```

## 📊 Metrics Availability by File Type

### Git-Based Metrics (Work for ALL file types)

These metrics work **universally** because they're based on Git history:

| Metric | Source | Works For |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Code Churn** | `git log --numstat` | All tracked files |
| **Commit Frequency** | `git log` | All tracked files |
| **Code Ownership** | `git blame` | All tracked files |
| **Shared Ownership** | `git log` + blame | All tracked files |
| **Author Count** | `git log` | All tracked files |

### Code-Based Metrics (Language-specific)

These metrics require language-specific parsers:

| Metric | Source | Works For |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | AST parsing | 9 supported languages |
| **Function/Method Count** | AST parsing | 9 supported languages |
| **Nesting Depth** | AST parsing | 9 supported languages |

## 🚀 Review Strategy Effectiveness

### Programming Languages: **95-100% Accuracy**

- Still valuable for prioritization

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Code Reviews

**Code Files:**
```bash
# Get comprehensive review strategy
python -m src.main src --review-strategy --review-branch-only
```
✅ Uses complexity + churn + ownership for accurate prioritization

**Mixed Codebase:**
```bash
# Include all files (code + docs + configs)
python -m src.main . --review-strategy
```
✅ Code files get detailed analysis, non-code files get churn-based review

### For Documentation Reviews

```bash
# Focus on documentation files
python -m src.main docs --review-strategy --list-hotspots
```
✅ Identifies frequently changed docs that need attention

### For Configuration Management

```bash
# Monitor config file changes
python -m src.main . --review-strategy --review-branch-only
```
✅ Highlights config files with high churn (potential instability)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

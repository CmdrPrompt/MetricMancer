# Issue #62: Cognitive Complexity Metric

> **Status**: Phase 1 Complete âœ… | **Branch**: `62-feature-add-cognitive-complexity-metric-to-complement-cyclomatic-complexity`

## Overview

This directory contains all documentation related to the implementation of Cognitive Complexity as a new KPI metric in MetricMancer.

**GitHub Issue**: #62  
**Started**: October 18, 2025  
**Motivation**: Cyclomatic Complexity alone doesn't capture code readability. Cognitive Complexity measures how difficult code is to understand by accounting for nesting depth.

## Algorithm Implementation

### SonarSource Cognitive Complexity Rules

The implementation follows the official SonarSource specification:
https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf

**Key Rules:**
1. **Basic structures**: +1 + nesting (if, for, while, except)
2. **else/elif**: +1 + nesting
3. **Nesting penalty**: +1 per nesting level
4. **Boolean operators**: +1 per sequence (not per operator)
5. **Ternary operators**: +1 + nesting
6. **Recursion**: +1
7. **Shortcuts**: No penalty (&&, ||, ??)

### Example Calculations

```python
# Flat code: Complexity = 4
def flat_code(x):
    if x > 0:          # +1
        return 1
    elif x < 0:        # +1
        return -1
    elif x == 0:       # +1
        return 0
    else:              # +1
        return None

# Nested code: Complexity = 6
def nested_code(x):
    if x > 0:          # +1 (nesting 0)
        if x > 10:     # +2 (nesting 1: 1 base + 1 penalty)
            if x > 20: # +3 (nesting 2: 1 base + 2 penalty)
                return 1
```

## Testing Strategy

### TDD Approach
Following Test-Driven Development:
1. **RED**: Write failing tests first
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 90% code coverage
- All algorithm aspects covered
- Real-world examples from MetricMancer codebase
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all cognitive complexity tests
pytest tests/kpis/test_cognitive_complexity.py -v

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/kpis/test_cognitive_complexity.py::TestCognitiveComplexityNesting -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/kpis/test_cognitive_complexity.py --cov=src/kpis/cognitive_complexity --cov-report=html
```

## Notes

### Why Cognitive Complexity?

Cyclomatic Complexity measures the number of linearly independent paths through code, but doesn't account for human understanding. Two functions with the same Cyclomatic Complexity can have vastly different readability:

- **Flat structure**: Easy to understand, predictable flow
- **Nested structure**: Hard to track context, mental stack overflow

Cognitive Complexity addresses this by penalizing nesting, making it a better indicator of maintainability.

### Design Decisions

1. **AST-based analysis**: Using Python's `ast` module for accurate parsing
2. **Nesting-aware recursion**: Track nesting level through recursive calculation
3. **Boolean operator optimization**: Sequences count as 1 (not per operator)
4. **Graceful error handling**: Syntax errors don't crash the analyzer
5. **SOLID principles**: Following MetricMancer's architecture guidelines

### Lessons Learned

- AST walking requires careful handling of child nodes
- `ast.iter_child_nodes()` includes all children (not just body statements)
- `else` and `elif` require special handling in AST
- TDD discipline catches edge cases early
- Real-world examples validate algorithm correctness

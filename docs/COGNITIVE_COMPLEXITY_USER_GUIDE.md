## What is Cognitive Complexity?

Cognitive Complexity is a metric that measures **how difficult code is to understand** from a human perspective. Unlike Cyclomatic Complexity which counts the number of execution paths, Cognitive Complexity accounts for:

- **Nesting depth** - Deeply nested code is harder to understand
- **Control flow breaks** - Each `if`, `for`, `while` adds complexity
- **Structural patterns** - Flat code is easier than nested code

Cognitive Complexity was developed by SonarSource and is used in industry tools like SonarQube and CodeClimate.

**Example:**

```python
# Cyclomatic: 4, Cognitive: 3 (Easy to understand)
def process_flat(action):
    if action == "start": return start()
    if action == "stop": return stop()
    if action == "reset": return reset()
    return default()

# Cyclomatic: 4, Cognitive: 6 (Hard to understand!)
def process_nested(data):
    if data:                    # +1
        if data.is_valid:       # +2 (1 + 1 for nesting)
            if data.processed:  # +3 (1 + 2 for nesting)
                return process(data)
```

Both functions have the same Cyclomatic Complexity (4), but the nested version has double the Cognitive Complexity because it's much harder to understand.

## Why Use Cognitive Complexity?

### Problems with Cyclomatic Complexity Alone

Cyclomatic Complexity is excellent for:
- ‚úÖ **Test coverage planning** - Tells you how many test cases you need
- ‚úÖ **Path counting** - Measures execution path complexity

But it has limitations:
- ‚ùå **Doesn't reflect understandability** - Flat and nested code scored the same
- ‚ùå **False positives** - Simple `switch` statements get high scores
- ‚ùå **Misleading priorities** - Might flag easy-to-read code as complex

### Benefits of Cognitive Complexity

Cognitive Complexity excels at:
- ‚úÖ **Refactoring prioritization** - Identifies truly hard-to-understand code
- ‚úÖ **Code review focus** - Helps reviewers find the most challenging sections
- ‚úÖ **Developer onboarding** - Shows new team members which code to avoid initially
- ‚úÖ **Technical debt assessment** - Quantifies cognitive load objectively

### When to Use Which Metric

| Task | Use Cyclomatic | Use Cognitive | Use Both |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| Plan test coverage | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | - |
| Prioritize refactoring | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | - |
| Code review planning | - | ‚úÖ | - |
| Assess maintainability | - | - | ‚úÖ |
| Onboarding assessment | - | ‚úÖ | - |
| Complete health check | - | - | ‚úÖ |

## Understanding the Algorithm

Cognitive Complexity follows these rules (per SonarSource specification):

### 1. Basic Increments (+1)

These structures add +1 complexity:
- `if`, `elif`, `else`
- `for`, `while` loops
- `except` blocks (exception handling)
- Ternary operators (`x if condition else y`)
- Recursion (function calling itself)

### 2. Nesting Penalty

**This is the key difference from Cyclomatic Complexity!**

Each level of nesting adds +1 to the increment:

```python
# Level 0 (no nesting)
if condition:        # +1 (0 nesting)
    do_something()

# Level 1 (nested once)
if outer:            # +1 (0 nesting)
    if inner:        # +2 (1 base + 1 nesting)
        do_something()

# Level 2 (nested twice)
if a:                # +1 (0 nesting)
    if b:            # +2 (1 base + 1 nesting)
        if c:        # +3 (1 base + 2 nesting)
            result()
```

**Total for deeply nested example: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6**

### 3. Boolean Operator Sequences

Sequences of `and`/`or` operators count as **+1 once**, not per operator:

```python
# Cognitive: +2 (not +4)
if a and b and c or d:  # +1 for if, +1 for boolean sequence
    do_something()
```

### 4. Recursion

Recursive calls add +1:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:          # +1
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)  # +1 (recursion)
# Total: 2
```

## Interpreting Results

### Recommended Thresholds

Based on SonarSource research and industry best practices:

| Cognitive Complexity | Risk Level | Indicator | Action |
|---------------------|------------|-----------|---------|
| **0-5** | ‚úÖ Low | Green | Excellent maintainability. No action needed. |
| **6-10** | üü° Medium | Yellow | Good. Monitor for growth. Consider refactoring if increasing. |
| **11-15** | üü† High | Orange | Consider refactoring. Breaking into smaller functions would help. |
| **16-25** | üî¥ Critical | Red | Refactor soon. Code is difficult to understand and maintain. |
| **25+** | üíÄ Severe | Dark Red | **Refactor immediately**. High risk of bugs and maintenance issues. |

### Real-World Interpretation

**Example: MetricMancer Code Review Advisor**

*Before refactoring:*
- Cyclomatic Complexity: 190
- Cognitive Complexity: 47 (üî¥ Critical)
- Status: Hard to understand, high maintenance risk

*After refactoring:*
- Cyclomatic Complexity: 210 (+10%)
- Cognitive Complexity: 8 (üü° Medium, -82%!)
- Status: Easy to understand, low maintenance risk

**Insight**: Cyclomatic went up slightly (more execution paths), but Cognitive dropped dramatically (much easier to understand). This is a successful refactoring!

## Best Practices for Refactoring

### Strategy 1: Extract Nested Logic

**Before (Cognitive: 9):**
```python
def process_order(order):
    if order:                           # +1
        if order.is_valid():            # +2
            if order.has_stock():       # +3
                if order.ship():        # +4 (hard to follow!)
                    return "Success"
```

**After (Cognitive: 4):**
```python
def process_order(order):
    if not order:                       # +1
        return None
    if not order.is_valid():            # +1
        return None
    if not order.has_stock():           # +1
        return None
    if order.ship():                    # +1
        return "Success"
```

**Technique**: Use guard clauses (early returns) to reduce nesting.

### Strategy 2: Extract Helper Functions

**Before (Cognitive: 12):**
```python
def analyze_user(user):
    if user:                            # +1
        if user.is_active:              # +2
            for order in user.orders:   # +3
                if order.total > 100:   # +4
                    # Complex processing...
```

**After (Cognitive: 2 + 4 = 6 total):**
```python
def analyze_user(user):
    if not user or not user.is_active:  # +2 (reduced!)
        return None
    return process_high_value_orders(user.orders)

def process_high_value_orders(orders):
    for order in orders:                # +1
        if order.total > 100:           # +2
            # Complex processing...
```

**Technique**: Extract nested logic into separate, well-named functions.

### Strategy 3: Use Data Structures

**Before (Cognitive: 10):**
```python
def get_discount(customer_type):
    if customer_type == "gold":         # +1
        if season == "holiday":         # +2
            return 0.30
        else:                           # +1
            return 0.20
    elif customer_type == "silver":     # +1
        # ... more nesting
```

**After (Cognitive: 1):**
```python
DISCOUNTS = {
    ("gold", "holiday"): 0.30,
    ("gold", "regular"): 0.20,
    ("silver", "holiday"): 0.15,
    # ...
}

def get_discount(customer_type):
    key = (customer_type, season)
    if key in DISCOUNTS:                # +1
        return DISCOUNTS[key]
```

**Technique**: Replace nested conditions with data structures (dicts, enums).

## Cognitive vs Cyclomatic Complexity

### Complementary Metrics

Think of them as measuring different aspects:

| Aspect | Cyclomatic | Cognitive |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **What it measures** | Number of execution paths | Mental effort to understand |
| **Best for** | Test coverage planning | Refactoring prioritization |
| **Algorithm** | Counts decision points | Counts + nesting penalty |
| **Flat code** | High score | Low score ‚úÖ |
| **Nested code** | Same score | High score ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| **Goal** | Keep low for testability | Keep low for maintainability |

### Example Comparison

```python
# Scenario 1: Guard Clauses (GOOD)
def validate_flat(user):
    if not user: return False           # Cyc: +1, Cog: +1
    if not user.email: return False     # Cyc: +1, Cog: +1
    if not user.age >= 18: return False # Cyc: +1, Cog: +1
    if not user.verified: return False  # Cyc: +1, Cog: +1
    return True
# Total: Cyclomatic=4, Cognitive=4

# Scenario 2: Nested Conditions (BAD)
def validate_nested(user):
    if user:                            # Cyc: +1, Cog: +1
        if user.email:                  # Cyc: +1, Cog: +2
            if user.age >= 18:          # Cyc: +1, Cog: +3
                if user.verified:       # Cyc: +1, Cog: +4
                    return True
    return False
# Total: Cyclomatic=4, Cognitive=10
```

**Insight**: Same Cyclomatic (4), but Cognitive is 2.5√ó higher for nested version!

### When They Disagree

**High Cyclomatic, Low Cognitive:**
- Many simple conditions (guard clauses, switch statements)
- ‚úÖ **Good code** - Easy to understand despite many paths
- üéØ **Action**: Focus on test coverage, no urgent refactoring

**Low Cyclomatic, High Cognitive:**
- Deep nesting with few branches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problematic code** - Hard to understand despite few paths
- üéØ **Action**: Refactor to reduce nesting (extract functions, guard clauses)

**High Both:**
- Complex nested logic with many branches
- üî¥ **High risk** - Hard to test AND understand
- üéØ **Action**: Urgent refactoring needed (highest priority)

## FAQ

### Q: My code has high Cyclomatic but low Cognitive. Is this okay?

**A:** Generally yes! This often indicates well-structured code with many simple cases (like guard clauses or switch statements). It's easy to understand but needs good test coverage. Focus on testing rather than refactoring.

### Q: Why does my Cognitive Complexity go up after refactoring?

**A:** This can happen if you convert flat code to nested code. Always aim to keep nesting shallow:
- ‚úÖ Use early returns (guard clauses)
- ‚úÖ Extract nested blocks to separate functions
- ‚ùå Avoid adding nesting levels

### Q: What's a good target for Cognitive Complexity?

**A:** Industry recommendations:
- **Functions**: Keep below 10 (ideally below 5)
- **Files**: Aggregate should be below 100
- **Modules**: Monitor trend, aim for decreasing over time

### Q: Can I configure Cognitive Complexity thresholds?

**A:** Not yet. Current implementation uses SonarSource's recommended thresholds. Custom thresholds are planned for a future release. Track the related issue for updates.

### Q: Does Cognitive Complexity work for all languages?

**A:** Currently **Python only**. Multi-language support (JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C#, Go, etc.) is planned using tree-sitter parsers. See related GitHub issue for the multi-language implementation roadmap.

### Q: How does MetricMancer calculate Cognitive Complexity?

**A:** MetricMancer uses Python's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) module to parse code and implements the SonarSource Cognitive Complexity algorithm. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical details.

### Q: Should I optimize for Cyclomatic or Cognitive first?

**A:** **Cognitive first** for maintainability! High Cognitive Complexity causes more day-to-day problems (bugs, slow development, hard reviews). Address Cyclomatic if test coverage is insufficient.

### Q: Can Cognitive Complexity detect all code smells?

**A:** No. Cognitive Complexity detects **structural complexity** but won't catch:
- Poor naming
- Duplicated code
- Long parameter lists
- Missing abstractions

Use it alongside code reviews and other quality metrics.

### Q: How often should I measure Cognitive Complexity?

**A:** Recommended schedule:
- **Every PR**: Check changed files in code reviews
- **Weekly/Sprint**: Track trends in CI/CD dashboards
- **Monthly**: Full codebase analysis to identify emerging hotspots
- **Quarterly**: Deep dive into highest-complexity areas

### Q: My team disagrees on complexity scores. How do I build consensus?

**A:** Tips for team adoption:
1. **Start with examples**: Show side-by-side flat vs nested code
2. **Use Quick Wins**: Focus on high-ROI refactorings first
3. **Set team thresholds**: Agree on acceptable ranges together
4. **Track trends**: Celebrate decreasing complexity over time
5. **Make it visible**: Include in code review checklists

### Q: Can I export Cognitive Complexity to our dashboard?

**A:** Yes! Use JSON output format:

```bash
python -m src.main src/ --output-format json --report-filename metrics.json
```

The JSON is compatible with dashboards like Grafana, Kibana, or custom tools.

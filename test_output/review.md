# 📋 Code Review Strategy Report

**Based on Complexity, Churn, and Ownership Metrics**

## 📊 Executive Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total files analyzed** | 0 |
| **Critical risk files** 🔴 | 0 (require immediate attention) |
| **High risk files** 🟡 | 0 (require senior review) |
| **Estimated total review time** | 0h 0m |

## 👥 Resource Allocation Guidance

### ⏱️ Recommended Review Time Distribution

### 👤 Reviewer Assignment Strategy

- **3 reviewers** (Critical risk/complexity >50): Senior architect + 2 experienced developers
- **2 reviewers** (High risk/complexity >20): Senior developer + peer reviewer
- **1 reviewer** (Low-medium risk): Standard peer review

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Pre-Review KPI Assessment

- Check complexity, churn, and ownership metrics before reviewing
- Adjust review depth based on risk level

### 2. Use Risk-Based Checklists

- **High complexity files**: Focus on simplification opportunities
- **High churn files**: Investigate root causes of instability
- **Single owner files**: Emphasize knowledge transfer

### 3. Knowledge Management

- Use reviews for knowledge transfer in single-owner files
- Document decisions in high-complexity areas
- Encourage pair programming for critical hotspots

### 4. Continuous Monitoring

- Track whether changes increase or decrease metrics
- Celebrate complexity reductions
- Monitor churn patterns for early warning signs
